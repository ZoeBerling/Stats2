## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# install.packages('ltm')
# WE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS WALKTHROUGH
#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtWsyUCGfhg
library(ltm)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
data(LSAT)
head(LSAT)
#z1 stands for 1 latent predictor
IRTmodel = ltm(LSAT~z1, IRT.param=TRUE)
summary(IRTmodel)
coef(IRTmodel)


```

```{r}

#item 3 is the most difficult and items 1,5 are the easiest
plot(IRTmodel, type ="ICC") #all items at once
plot(IRTmodel, type="ICC", item = 3) #one item at a time
plot(IRTmodel, type="IIC", item=0) #test information function
#gives you every combination of response patterns
#talks about this at 10 minutes in statistics of doom 30min video
factor.scores(IRTmodel)
person.fit(IRTmodel)
item.fit(IRTmodel)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
